"We propose DACC (Distributed Access Control in Clouds) algorithm, where one or more KDCs distribute keys to data owners and users." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"DACC also supports revocation of users, without redistributing keys to all the users of cloud services. We show that our approach results in lower communication, computation and storage overheads, compared to existing models and schemes." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"Hence we use the cryptographic technique called Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) to achieve access control in clouds." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"Earlier work (by Yu et al [17]) assumed that owners encrypt data with attributes that they possess and send it to the cloud to securely store them. The owners give not only access rights to users, but also give them attributes and corresponding secret keys." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"The access policy is in the form of a tree, with attributes" (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"as leaf nodes and Boolean functions AND and OR as internal nodes. Threshold gates t-out-of-n are included in this representation, because they are constructed from AND and OR gates when t = n and t = 1, respectively." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"However, this may not hold, because in a distributed system, authorities can fail or be corrupt." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"The attribute authority (KDC) in all mentioned protocols is assumed to be honest. However, this may not hold, because in a distributed system, authorities can fail or be corrupt." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"Chase and Chow [24] devised a multi-authority ABE protocol which required no trusted authority. However, the main problem was that a user required at least one attribute from each of the authorities, which might not be practical." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"ABE was used for access control. They used cryptographic protocol [24], with multiple authorities to distribute attributes for access control." (Ruj et al 2011:93)
"Wang et al [26] proposed a hierarchical access control mechanism for cloud storage. It relies on Bethencourt et al [22] CP-ABE and Hierarchical IBE [27]. The attribute authorities are arranged in a hierarchical way, with a root master (playing the role of a trusted KDC), and several domain masters who generate keys for the domains and distribute them to the users." (Ruj et al 2011:93)
"In DACC, the cloud is assumed to be honest. If this requirement is not possible to satisfy, then care should be taken, that the cloud does not modify the data that it contains." (Ruj et al 2011:97)

"We propose a new decentralized access control scheme for secure data storage in clouds, that supports anonymous authentication." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"This is achieved by means of searchable encryption [3], [4]." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"It is important to have log of the transactions performed; however, it is an important concern to decide how much information to keep in the log. Accountability has been addressed in TrustCloud [8]. Secure provenance has been studied in [9]." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"Access control in clouds is gaining attention because it is important that only authorized users have access to valid service. A huge amount of information is being stored in the cloud, and much of this is sensitive information. Care should be taken to ensure access control of this sensitive information" (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There are broadly three types of access control: User Based Access Control (UBAC), Role Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There has been some work on ABAC in clouds (for example, [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). All these work use a cryptographic primitive known as Attribute Based Encryption (ABE). The The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [17] has been proposed for ABAC in clouds [18]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Access control in health care has been studied in [12], [13]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Access control in online social networking has been studied in [19]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There are cryptographic protocols like ring signatures [20], mesh signatures [21], group signatures [22], which can be used in these situations." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"a new protocol known as Attribute Based Signature (ABS) has been applied. ABS was proposed by Maji et al. [23]. In ABS, users have a claim predicate associated with a message." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Existing work [38], [18], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] on access control in cloud are centralized in nature." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Although Yang et al. [34] proposed a decentralized approach, their technique does not authenticate users, who want to remain anonymous while accessing the cloud. In an earlier work, Ruj et al. [16] proposed a distributed access control mechanism in clouds." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"We have presented a decentralized access control technique with anonymous authentication, which provides user revocation and prevents replay attacks. The cloud does not know the identity of the user who stores information, but only verifies the user's credentials. Key distribution is done in a decentralized way. One limitation is that the cloud knows the access policy for each record stored in the cloud. In future, we would like to hide the attributes and access policy of a user." (Ruj et al 2014:393)

"In order to permit a requested operation, a reference monitor must verify evidence that the request should be granted. In classical approaches to access control, this evidence may be the presence of an authenticated identity on an access-control list, or the verification of a capability presented with the request." (Bauer et al 2005:81)
"In this paper, we introduce a distributed strategy by which this proof can be generated and show that the strategy outperforms prior approaches in many contexts." (Bauer et al 2005:81)
"In traditional approaches to distributed authorization, credentials are distributed across multiple users. A single user (either the requester of a resource or its owner, depending on the model) is responsible for proving that access should be allowed, and in the course of proving the user may fetch credentials from other users. All users except for the one proving access are passive; their only responsibility is to make their credentials available for download. We propose a different model: each user is both a repository of credentials and an active participant in the proof-generation process. In this model, a user who is generating a proof is now able to ask other users not only for their certificates, but also to prove for him subgoals that are part of his proof. Each user has a tactical theorem prover that he uses to prove both his own and other users' goals. In such a system there are multiple strategies for creating proofs." (Bauer et al 2005:84)
"Previous work on distributed authorization systems largely did not focus on practical strategies for collecting the certificates used to show that a request satisfies an access-control policy. However, attention to these strategies is necessary for the deployment of rich certificatebased access control, particularly in cases where credentials are created dynamically with user involvement."

		This paper was the foundational work for the standardization of RBAC models. It includes 4 proposed reference models for RBAC, and formal definitions, as well as some future work left to be done.
		Problems:
		- "One of the outstanding research problems in this area is to develop a systematic approach to the design and analysis of RBAC congurations. Some recent research on the design and analysis of role hierarchies has been reported [8, 9, 14]."
		- "The management aspects of RBAC need further work."},

"these models have often found to be inadequate for open and decentralized multi-centric systems where the user population is dynamic and the identity of all users are not known in advance." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:50)
"we propose a trust based access control model called TrustBAC." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:50)
"Users are assigned to trust levels instead of roles based on a number of factors like user credentials, user behavior history, user recommendation etc." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:50)
"The TrustBAC model thus incorporates the advantages of both the role based access control model and credential based access control models." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:50)
"Thus, with RBAC, security is managed at a level corresponding to an organization's human resource structure. Notwithstanding the success of the RBAC model, researchers have often found the model to be inadequate for open and decentralized multi-centric systems where the user population is dynamic and the identity of all users are not known in advance." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:50)
"trust levels in the users can be determined not only by using the credentials presented by the user but also from the results of past interactions with the user, from recommendations about the user and/or knowledge about other characteristics of the user. A user is mapped to different trust levels based on these information. Trust levels (and not users, unlike in conventional RBAC) are then mapped to roles of RBAC." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:51)
"One advantage of TMAC model is it allows role-based permissions across ob ject types as well as fine-grained, identity-based control on individual users in certain roles and to individual ob ject instances." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:51)
"Basic purpose of an access control mechanism is to protect system resources by restricting the user's activities on them." (Chakraborty and Ray 2006:56)

	abstract = {With the growing use of wireless networks and mobile devices, we are moving towards an era where location information will be necessary for access control. The use of location information can be used for enhancing the security of an application, and it can also be exploited to launch attacks. For critical applications, a formal model for location-based access control is needed that increases the security of the application and ensures that the location information cannot be exploited to cause harm. In this paper, we show how the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model can be extended to incorporate the notion of location. We show how the different components in the RBAC model are related with location and how this location information can be used to determine whether a subject has access to a given object. This model is suitable for applications consisting of static and dynamic objects, where location of the subject and object must be considered before granting access.},

	isbn = {978-3-642-03354-4},
	abstract = {We investigate a security framework for collaborative applications that relies on the role-based access control (RBAC) model. In our framework, roles are pre-defined and organized in a hierarchy (partial order). However, we assume that users are not previously identified, therefore the actions that they can perform are dynamically determined based on their own attribute values and on the attribute values associated with the resources. Those values can vary over time (e.g., the user's location or whether the resource is open for visiting) thus enabling or disabling a user's ability to perform an action on a particular resource. In our framework, constraint values form partial orders and determine the association of actions with the resources and of users with roles. We have implemented our framework by exploring the capabilities of semantic web technologies, and in particular of OWL 1.1, to model both our framework and the domain of interest and to perform several types of reasoning. In addition, we have implemented a user interface whose purpose is twofold: (1) to offer a visual explanation of the underlying reasoning by displaying roles and their associations with users (e.g., as the user's locations vary); and (2) to enable monitoring of users that are involved in a collaborative application. Our interface uses the Google Maps API and is particularly suited to collaborative applications where the users' geospatial locations are of interest.},

Although some proposals for ABAC have been published, and even implemented and standardized, there is no consensus on precisely what is meant by ABAC or the required features of ABAC. There is no widely accepted ABAC model as there are for DAC, MAC and RBAC. This paper takes a step towards this end by constructing an ABAC model that has “just sufficient” features to be “easily and naturally” configured to do DAC, MAC and RBAC. For this purpose we understand DAC to mean owner-controlled access control lists, MAC to mean lattice-based access control with tranquility and RBAC to mean flat and hierarchical RBAC. Our central contribution is to take a first cut at establishing formal connections between the three successful classical models and desired ABAC models.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has received considerable attention in both industry and academia in recent years. There has been significant research on access control models for IoT in academia, while industrial deployment of several cloud-enabled IoT platforms have already been introduced. However, as yet there is no consensus on a formal access control model for cloud-enabled IoT. Currently, most of the cloud-enabled IoT platforms utilize some customized form of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), but RBAC by itself is insufficient to address the dynamic requirements of IoT. In this paper, we study one of the commercial cloud-IoT platform, AWS IoT, and develop a formal access control model for it, which we call AWS-IoTAC. We do this by extending AWS cloud's formal access control (AWSAC) model, previously published in the academic literature, to incorporate the IoT specific components. The AWS-IoTAC model is abstracted from AWS IoT documentation and has been formalized based on AWSAC definitions. We show how this model maps to a recently proposed Access Control Oriented (ACO) architecture for cloud-enabled IoT. We demonstrate a smart-home use case in AWS IoT platform, and inspired by this use case, we propose some Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) extensions to the AWS-IoTAC model for enhancing the flexibility of access control in IoT.},

"To avoid users having to store and manage a huge number of (secret) keys, we exploit the key derivation method via tokens. Exploiting tokens, the release to each user of a set of keys K = \{k1 , . . . , kn\} can be equivalently obtained by the release to each user of a single key ki ∈ K and the publication of a set of tokens allowing to derive (directly or indirectly) all keys kj ∈ K, j 6= i."

"Traditional access control mechanisms rely on a reference monitor to mediate access to protected resources. Reference monitors are inherently centralized" (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"ty. Cryptographic access control is a new distributed access control paradigm designed for a global federation of information systems." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"Current access control mechanisms invoke a reference monitor [1] to verify a principal's right to access a protected object every time the object is referenced." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"ACLs do not scale well, because it is difficult to delegate the right to delegate, i.e. modify the ACL. This means that the ACLs have to be organised into a hierarchy where the right to delegate access rights corresponds to the right to modify the ACL in a specific branch of the hierarchy, Thus, the ACL hierarchy must reflect the structure of the entire organisation.1" (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"In addition, a distributed reference monitor enforces a homogeneous security policy on a heterogeneous environment and requires global knowledge on the part of the entity that defines security policy." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"We therefore need to rethink the notion of access control in large-" (Harrington and Jensen 2003:158)
"scale open systems, such as the Internet, in a way that separates enforceme nt of access control policies from the storage of objects in the system and, at the same time, ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data stored and transferred in the system." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"l, a novel access control mechanism that eliminates the need for a reference monitor and relies exclusively on cryptography to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data stored in the system." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"Data are encrypted with the private key, also called the encryption key and decrypted with the public key, also called the decryption key." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"The advantage of this approach is that it is inherently distributed, i.e., the tokens needed to access data only have meaning where data is used, so there is no need for coordination of access control state among clients and servers in the system." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"The cryptographic access control mechanism is designed to operate in an open network where establishing the identity of the client conveys no information about the likely behaviour of the client and thus, is irrelevant to the secure operation of the server." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"The cryptographic access control mechanism seeks to reposition the burden of access control from the server to the client." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"using a log-structured file system [22, 30, 25, 6], where modifications are written to a log instead of overwriting disk blocks. An attacker may write false log entries, but this is easily detected and corrupt disk blocks can be ignored, i.e. by reading the latest entry written to the log that decrypts correctly." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"A simple approach is to provide the server with the decryption key, which allows it to identify incorrect log-entries and remove them from the log. However, the decryption key alone does not allow the server to detect invalid log-entries in unstructured binary data, so we require that the client signs log-entries, with the encryption key before they are sent to the server." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:159)
"Data stored on the server are encrypted with a symmetric algorithm and signed with the encryption key as before. The digital signature is used by clients to guarantee integrity of the data and by the server to provide a means for log compression as described in Section 2.2." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:160)
"It is a fundamental requirement of our system that the user have complete trust in the client machine." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:160)
"All data stored locally are unencrypted and if a malicious agent succeeds in compromising the client machine then data confidentiality is destroyed." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:160)
"However compromising a client only affects the subset of system files which are associated with that client." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:160)
"The system is designed to operate over a public unsecured network. All data are encrypted by the client before the remote storage procedures are invoked. This ensures that all data is encrypted prior to being transmitted across the network. All data sent from the server to the client is also encrypted. The use of digital signatures protects against deliberate or accidental changes to the payload of the network packets. This effectively means that data integrity and confidentiality are guaranteed and the user need not place any trust in the network." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:160)
"Contrary to traditional access control mechanisms, cryptographic access control implements a client centric view of the trusted computing base (TCB)." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:161)
"Minimal trust is placed in the server and any interceptor of messages can only inflict as much damage as a malicious server. The strong encryption safeguards data confidentiality and the signature validation routines protect data integrity." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:163)
"Security policies are defined by the users and enforced by the way that they distribute keys. The current prototype lacks a secure key distribution mechanism, which would facilitate file sharing." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:164)
"We have described these challenges and have offered a critique of the suitability of the cryptographic access control mechanism for use in modern distributed systems. We have found the cryptographic access control mechanism to be flexible and scalable yet powerful enough to effectively protect resources in insecure environments." (Harrington and Jensen 2003:164)

"s. In this paper we propose a trusted computing architecture to enforce access control policies in such applications." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:147)
"By monitoring and verifying the integrity and properties of running applications in a platform using the functions of trusted computing, the TRM can enforce various policies on behalf of object owners." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:147)
"In this paper, we consider a client to be a computing platform such that a user (object owner) can distribute some objects directly or indirectly to it, and other users (including the owner) can access the object on the platform." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:147)
"The lack of strong security mechanisms on client platforms in general, and the push for an open environment on computing devices, such as PDAs, smart phones, notebooks, etcetera, leave the client extremely vulnerable to software attacks. It has been generally accepted for some time that software alone cannot provide an adequate foundation for building a high-assurance trusted platform." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:147)
"t. TC technologies seek to protect data in creation, processing, storage, and transfer primarily by exposing the cryptographic secrets required to access the data only to software which has a verifiable chain of trust, be it on a single computer or across multiple computers." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:148)
"TC primitives include cryptographic operations and trusted storage of root keys as a foundation for security." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:148)
"TC focuses on the assurance that an entity does behave in the expected manner through mechanisms of integrity measurement, storage, and reporting." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:148)
"2.2.1 Decentralized Dissemination Control In decentralized dissemination control (DCON), an object is distributed to a client platform, where the object owner may want to enforce some security policies to control the access, i.e., by trusting the subject that receives and views the object, and the platform and the state of applications." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:149)
"In recent and emerging computing models, a server needs to trust a client, with respect to both platform and user authentication." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:149)
"is that security policies are enforced on the client platform. Policy enforcement is dependent on trust between platforms." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:149)
"In modern open systems certainly the application and possibly the operating system are likely to be much more dynamic requiring mechanisms to guarantee their integrity." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:149)
"In distributed and decentralized systems, an object or policy owner needs to trust that the valid user is authenticated and authorized in a client platform before being allowed to access a protected object." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:149)
"The first step to control access to an object in a client platform is the generation and distribution of the policy and the object encryption secret." (Sandhu and Zhang 2005:151)
"For global and open environment, this may rely on some trusted third party. For example, an independent CA certifies that software with particular integrity value and patch version satisfies a particular property, and this CA is trusted by an attestation challenger (e.g., Alice's platform).

	abstract = {Secure instant messaging is utilized in two variants: one-to-one communication and group communication. While the first variant has received much attention lately (Frosch et al., EuroS\&P16; Cohn-Gordon et al., EuroS\&P17; Kobeissi et al., EuroS\&P17), little is known about the cryptographic mechanisms and security guarantees of secure group communication in instant messaging.

To approach an investigation of group instant messaging protocols, we first provide a comprehensive and realistic security model. This model combines security and reliability goals from various related literature to capture relevant properties for communication in dynamic groups. Thereby the definitions consider their satisfiability with respect to the instant delivery of messages. To show its applicability, we analyze three widely used real-world protocols: Signal, WhatsApp, and Threema. Since these protocols and their implementations are mostly undocumented for the public and two out of three applications among them are closed source, we describe the group protocols employed in Signal, WhatsApp, and Threema. By applying our model, we reveal several shortcomings with respect to the security definition. Therefore we propose generic countermeasures to enhance the protocols regarding the required security and reliability goals. Our systematic analysis reveals that (1) the communications’ integrity – represented by the integrity of all exchanged messages – and (2) the groups’ closeness – represented by the members’ ability of managing the group – are not end-to-end protected.

We additionally show that strong security properties, such as Future Secrecy which is a core part of the one-to-one communication in the Signal protocol, do not hold for its group communication.},

abstract = {In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user posses a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the conﬁdentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept conﬁdential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous AttributeBased Encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user’s keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user’s credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.},
