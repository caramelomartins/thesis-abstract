abstract = {Business process modeling is an important part of information systems design as well as of any business engineering or reengineering activity. Business process modeling languages provide standard ways of presentation and communication between different stakeholders. A business process model is the externalization of the conceptualization of some parts of the object world that deal with those aspects that pertain to the way business transactions are carried out and supported by an information system. This paper deals with an essential issue in this context, namely the assessment of the quality of business processes through their models. This objective raises two major issues, (a) the identification of the quality factors relevant to business processes, and (b) the definition of the metrics that provide a means for objectively measuring quality of business processes. These two issues are addressed in this paper through a quality evaluation framework, known as QEF that enables business process modelers to explicitly incorporate a wide variety of requirements corresponding to quality factors. Quality factors of business processes are defined in this paper and categorized into different quality dimensions. Application of the quality framework as well as proposed quality dimensions, factors and metrics are discussed through an illustrative example.},

	abstract = {Today's data centers offer IT services mostly hosted on dedicated physical servers. Server virtualization provides a technical means for server consolidation. Thus, multiple virtual servers can be hosted on a single server. Server consolidation describes the process of combining the workloads of several different servers on a set of target servers. We focus on server consolidation with dozens or hundreds of servers, which can be regularly found in enterprise data centers. Cost saving is among the key drivers for such projects. This paper presents decision models to optimally allocate source servers to physical target servers while considering real-world constraints. Our central model is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Therefore, besides an exact solution method, a heuristic is presented to address large-scale server consolidation projects. In addition, a preprocessing method for server load data is introduced allowing for the consideration of quality-of-service levels. Extensive experiments were conducted based on a large set of server load data from a data center provider focusing on managerial concerns over what types of problems can be solved. Results show that, on average, server savings of 31 percent can be achieved only by taking cycles in the server workload into account.},

	abstract = {Service systems engineering (SSE) focuses on the systematic design and development of service systems. Guided by a value proposition, service systems enable value co-creation through a configuration of actors and resources (often including a service architecture, technology, information, and physical artifacts), therefore constituting complex socio-technical systems. IS research can play a leading role in understanding and developing service systems. SSE calls for research leading to actionable design theories, methods and approaches for systematically designing, developing and piloting service systems, based upon understanding the underlying principles of service systems. Three major challenges have been identified: engineering service architectures, engineering service systems interactions, and engineering resource mobilization, i.e. extending the access to and use of resources by means of IT. Researching SSE is challenging. Assessing the models, methods, or artifacts of SSE often requires embedded research within existing or even novel service systems. Consequently, approaches such as piloting IT-based innovations, design research or action research are the most promising for SSE research. As an integrative discipline, IS is in a unique position to spearhead the efforts in advancing the architecture, interaction, and resource base of service systems with evidence-based design.},
