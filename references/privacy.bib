	abstract = {Participation in social networking sites has dramatically increased in recent years. Services such as Friendster, Tribe, or the Facebook allow millions of individuals to create online proﬁles and share personal information with vast networks of friends - and, often, unknown numbers of strangers. In this paper we study patterns of information revelation in online social networks and their privacy implications. We analyze the online behavior of more than 4,000 Carnegie Mellon University students who have joined a popular social networking site catered to colleges. We evaluate the amount of information they disclose and study their usage of the site’s privacy settings. We highlight potential attacks on various aspects of their privacy, and we show that only a minimal percentage of users changes the highly permeable privacy preferences.},

	abstract = {Recent widely publicized data breaches have exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. Some reports point to alarming increases in both the size and frequency of data breaches, spurring institutions around the world to address what appears to be a worsening situation. But, is the problem actually growing worse? In this article, we study a popular public dataset and develop Bayesian Generalized Linear Models to investigate trends in data breaches. Analysis of the model shows that neither size nor frequency of data breaches has increased over the past decade. We ﬁnd that the increases that have attracted attention can be explained by the heavytailed statistical distributions underlying the dataset. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the size of data breaches is well modeled by the log-normal family of distributions and that the daily frequency of breaches is described by a negative binomial distribution. These distributions may provide clues to the generative mechanisms that are responsible for the breaches. Additionally, our model predicts the likelihood of breaches of a particular size in the future. For example, we ﬁnd that between 15 September 2015 and 16 September 2016 there is only a 53.6\% chance of a breach of 10 million records or more in the USA. Regardless of any trend, data breaches are costly, and we combine the model with two different cost models to project that in the next 3 years breaches could cost up to \$179 billion.},
