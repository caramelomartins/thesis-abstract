\section{Methodology}
\label{chap:methods}

We have aimed, while conducting this research, to follow what has been proposed in \cite{peffers_design_2007} while, at the same time, keeping in mind the practical guidelines laid out in \cite{hevner_design_2004}. Both papers are widely cited contributions to the body of knowledge, with case studies that exemplify applicability to conducting DSR. They have matured through years of refinement and have been wildly used by the IS research community, making them a suitable choice for a methodology to follow. To exemplify the usage breadth of these approaches, we can verify that they have been used or suggested, and cited, in IS research on supply chain on the internet of things \cite{geerts_supply_2014}, quality of business processes \cite{heidari_quality_2014}, modeling of resources and resource management \cite{speitkamp_mathematical_2010} and service systems engineering \cite{bohmann_service_2014}. The chosen methodology for this research is Design Science Research Methodology. It was also described how the contents of this thesis, in each chapter, intersect with the chosen methodology, both in theory and practice.
